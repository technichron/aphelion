general:
	get input working - relies on emulator window
	? central aphelion program that can call assembler and emulator
assembler:
	add compound instruction interpretation
	add char interpretation
	add command line arguments so i dont have to edit the damn file every time
emulator:
	replace command line out with window interface
	command line args for this too
